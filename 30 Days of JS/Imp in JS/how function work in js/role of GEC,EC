1. We learnt how functions work in JS.
2. At first a global execution context is created, which consists of Memory and code and has 2 phases: Memory allocation phase and code execution phase.
3. In the first phase, the variables are assigned "undefined" while functions have their own code.
4.  Whenever there is a function invocation a local EC is created and pushed to the call stack having its own local and global scope
5. Once the function ends, the EC is removed from the call stack.
6. When the program ends, even the global EC is pulled out of the call stack.
